        <td><p>I have learned many of the techniques used to create a basic website and how to use CSS styling to make the website have a somewhat professional view. I also have learned it is very hard to make the website have an updated professional view to match modern looking websites. I have used bootstrap and other webforms in previous classes that help make a website with a much sleeker look. I did have to use the inspect tool to look at centering and color schemes for readability. The more I use html from scratch, the more proficient I am at fine tuning certain aspects of web page design.Â </p></td>
