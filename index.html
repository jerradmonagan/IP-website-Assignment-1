        <td><p>I have learned many of the techniques used to create a basic website and how to use CSS styling to make the website have a somewhat professional view. I also have learned it is very hard to make the website have an updated professional view to match modern looking websites. I have used bootstrap and other webforms in previous classes that help make a website with a much sleeker look. I did have to use the inspect tool to look at centering and color schemes for readability. The more I use html from scratch, the more proficient I am at fine tuning certain aspects of web page design.Â </p></td>

          <td><p>For this assignment, I took the instructions from a previous course on an application that I created using C# and visual studio. I
          learned that using an old design was helpful but I still had to change much of how the code was structured due to language differences along
          with assignment requirements.</p></td>

        <tr>
          <td><p>For this assignment, I found that JavaScript was easy to pick up due to my previous experience with other OOP languages. I did find it
          annoying that I often had to keep forcing the conversion of data types vs just defining them at the start. I think there would be situations
          that JS loose data typing could be handy, this is just the first time I have had to experience it.</p></td>

          improve upon the look of the website.</p></td>

              <td><p>In this project I made two versions. One I made using the trial version of adobe animate CC. Then I made a second
              project using just the basic tools given in the tutorials in discussion board and in the assignment reading.
              I used bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery in this project for both version. They both had their difficulty, learning curve wise.
              In the end I think this takes a lot creativity and artistic ability, which I lack.</p></td>
