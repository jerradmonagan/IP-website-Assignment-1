Assignment Description
This is your first web page creation assignment for the course.  It is critical that you understand how to configure your web account, create folders, and properly upload files to the server. You are required to complete this assignment without the assistance of an authoring tool (e.g., DreamWeaver or NVU) as these skills are essential for the mastery of subsequent assignments.
 
Part 1
In this assignment, you will be creating the structure for the location of the following assignments and folder structure. You are first going to create a folder named cop4819 in your username folder. In the cop4819 folder, you will place an html file named index.html.  This web page will be an ePortfolio that provides links, brief descriptions, and reflections to all the assignments that you will do in this course.  An ePortfolio is a reflective device for you to watch your skills develop over time and for you to showcase to other interested parties.  The index.html file in the cop4819 folder should have the following information:
 
The title of the web page should be “COP 4813 OR COP 5819: Internet Programming”.
The web page should have a heading (H1) with “ePortfolio for COP 4813 OR COP 5819: Internet Programming” as the title and a smaller heading with your name centered on the page.
The information should be structured using a Table. Alternatively, you are welcome to use CSS to structure the information on the page. Regardless, the page should have a professional look-and-feel.
After the heading information, you should place a horizontal rule to separate the heading information from the first paragraph. 
The first paragraph heading should be titled “Assignment 1”, which should be an active link to the assign1/index.html web page using a relative path (About Me).
Using the paragraph tag and a combination of text formatting tags, place a couple paragraphs directly under “Assignment 1” heading that provides a description of the first assignment and a reflection about what you learned.  You should use your words to describe this assignment – not mine. 
Place an unordered list under the paragraphs that lists the learning objective of this assignment as you interpret them. Keep in mind, you will have to do this for each assignment in the course upon completion and submission.
Place another horizontal rule after the paragraph.  This web page will be used to link to all the subsequent assignments in the course.
 
Part 2
Now that you have completed the first part of the assignment, we can move on to the next.  You are to create an “About Me” web page for your first assignment in the cop4813/assign1 folder.  This about me page should contain the following information:
 
Your full name.
An active link to your email account using mailto.
The information should be structured using a Table or be structured using CSS. The page must have a professional look-and-feel.
Three to four descriptive paragraphs about your past, present, and future. Provide things that you are willing to share online, such as your academic and professional aspirations.
An image of yourself that is properly aligned with the text (text should not touch the image) in a web compatible format (i.e., jpg). If you do not have a digital image of yourself, I suggest finding a friend with a camera phone, a digital camera, or a scanner for you to use.
An unordered list of your favorite web sites (minimum of 3) as active links (absolute paths). The links should open in new tabs/windows.
The use of the font tag to change the color of some portion of the text on the page. This tag has been deprecated. I know this. Use it anyway, I am trying to make a point.
Your schedule of courses for this semester, including the meeting times (or online), course title, and course prefix/number in a Table format.
An active link back to the ePortfolio web page created as the first part of the assignment.
 
The “About Me” me web page should be properly formatted and should not contain any information or images that are disrespectful or that you would not want to share with everyone. 
 
Part 3
In the first and second part of the assignment, you created static web pages using a variety of html tags. Now, you are going to create a style sheet to standardize the look and feel of your ePortfolio. The cascading style sheet will modify each of the elements in your ePortfolio so there is a consistent format.  Follow the instructions to create and integrate your cascading style sheet:
 
Create a separate cascading style sheet file (.css) file extension for all changes to the ePortfolio.
Link your ePortfolio pages to the cascading style sheet (external).
Create a rollover effect for the active links in your ePortfolio.  The rollover effect should change the color and appearance of the text link when hovered over.
Standardize the paragraph tag so that it has a consistent font-family and color.
Standardize the heading tags (all of them) to have the same font.
Standardize the body tag to a consistent margin.
Standardize the horizontal rule to have a consistent color
Standardize the background image (repeating background image) on all pages that does not interfere with the text. I suggest using the background color of the table to overlap the background images of the body.
Standardize the unordered list tag to the same list style image, and position.
 
You are welcome to go above and beyond the expectations set in this assignment.  Be sure to, at minimum, meet the expectations set in the specifications.
 
Grading Rubric
This assignment will be evaluated using a 100 point scale.  Each of the specifications will be worth a varying number of points.  If you do not understand any of the specifications, post immediately to the discussion board on Canvas.  As long as you meet all the specifications, you should receive full credit.  Late assignments will not be accepted.
