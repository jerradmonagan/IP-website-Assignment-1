I also have learned it is very hard to make the website have an updated professional view to match modern looking websites. I have used bootstrap and other webforms in previous classes that help make a website with a much sleeker look. I did have to use the inspect tool to look at centering and color schemes for readability. The more I use html from scratch, the more proficient I am at fine tuning certain aspects of web page design.Â </p></td>

        with assignment requirements.</p></td>

        annoying that I often had to keep forcing the conversion of data types vs just defining them at the start. I think there would be situations
        that JS loose data typing could be handy, this is just the first time I have had to experience it.</p></td>
